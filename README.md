# cow-bull-in-c
The classic Cow-Bull word game, included mechanism for hint when player gets stuck
guess with only capital letters
RULES:
the computer thinks of a 4 letter word (no repeating letters)
the game is to guess the word within a set number of tries.
you can make a guess(like you do in wordle) and the computer gives you the number of cows and bulls
cow = one of the letters is in the right positino in the right place
bull = one of the letters is in the word but in the wrong position
you can ask for a hint using the "hint" guess.
hint (in all smalls) = displays a hint for the player

over 2000 words included.
good luck!
